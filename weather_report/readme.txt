🌦 Weather & Air Quality Analysis Dashboard – Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project is an interactive Weather & Air Quality Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to provide real-time and forecast-based insights into weather conditions and air quality metrics for major Indian cities.

The dashboard combines weather forecasting, environmental indicators, and air quality data to help users make informed decisions related to health, travel, and daily planning.

🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this dashboard is to:

Analyze current and forecasted weather conditions

Monitor air quality levels and pollutants

Present data in a visually intuitive and decision-friendly format

This dashboard can be useful for:

City residents

Travelers

Environmental analysts

Weather-dependent industries
